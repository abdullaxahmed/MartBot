# MartBot - Supermarket Assistant Robot

## Overview

MartBot is an autonomous mobile robot designed specifically to assist elderly and disabled customers in supermarket environments. This graduation project combines advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and user-centered design to create an accessible shopping companion. The robot provides intelligent navigation guidance through store aisles, delivers comprehensive product information via an intuitive touchscreen interface, and features an AI-powered self-checkout system using computer vision technology. Built on the ROS framework with autonomous navigation and multi-sensor integration, MartBot aims to enhance retail accessibility and promote independent shopping experiences for users with mobility challenges and special needs.

## Design
MartBot features a differential drive configuration optimized for supermarket environments:

- **Functional Form Factor:** Designed to navigate standard supermarket aisles (typically 100â€“150 cm wide)
- **Integrated Shopping Basket:** Built-in compartment for grocery transportation
- **Touchscreen Interface:** Mounted on the basket for intuitive user interaction, integrated with an onboard camera for product scanning
- **Sensor Mounts:** Dedicated slots for depth camera and LiDAR placement, with an optimized height and field of view
